Should be able to sort based on ingredients, like all recipes with mozzarella,
prosciutto and meat. Or all breakfast recipes. Also want to be able to search
by time of preparation, time to cook, pretty much by anything.

It'd be cool if I could also visualize my recipes: charts of breakdown by
categories, difficulty, tags, etc.

A separate portion for ingredients on hand. Keeping inventory on what's in
the fridge/cabinets. If only labels had RFIDs in them.
